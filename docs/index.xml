      <description>The theme for the second jam was Make it Thinky. We were encouraged to select any genre that we liked, and try to make a thinky experience out of it.

      <description>The goal for the first jam was to figure out how I can distill what I enjoy most about city builders, and build the simplest version of that for the jam. When I say city builder, I am mostly referring to games like Pharaoh and Caesar 3.
